# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ChittyPortal is part of the ChittyOS Framework v1.0.1 ecosystem. This repository appears to be in early initialization phase and will likely serve as a portal/gateway component within the broader ChittyOS architecture.

## ChittyOS Integration

This project integrates with the ChittyOS Framework slash command system. The following commands are available:

### Core Validation
- `/chittycheck` or `/check` - Execute ChittyID compliance validation
- `/health` - Run project health check
- `/chittyid` - ChittyID system operations

### Development & Testing
- `/dev` - Start development environment
- `/test` - Run test suite
- `/status` - Check project status

### Git Operations
- `/commit` - Commit with ChittyID integration
- `/sync` - Synchronize with remote repositories
- `/branch` - Branch management operations

## ChittyID Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All IDs must be minted from https://id.chitty.cc
- NO local ID generation allowed
- All identity operations must use the ChittyID service
- Compliance checked via `/chittycheck` command

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository, the development workflow will be established as the project grows. Expected patterns based on ChittyOS Framework:

```bash
# System validation (run first)
/chittycheck

# Development workflow
/dev              # Start development
/test             # Run tests
/status           # Check status
```

## Architecture Context

As part of ChittyOS Framework, this project will likely integrate with:
- **ChittyID System** - Identity and validation
- **MCP Connectors** - AI platform integration
- **Cross-Session Sync** - State management
- **Hook System** - Event automation
- **Evidence-Based Operations** - Audit trails

## Repository State

Currently in initialization phase:
- Main branch exists but no commits
- @chittyos/ subdirectory present (empty git repo)
- Minimal file structure established

## Security Requirements

- Credentials managed via 1Password CLI integration
- ChittyID compliance mandatory for all operations
- Evidence collection for system audit trails
- macOS system integration patterns expected
