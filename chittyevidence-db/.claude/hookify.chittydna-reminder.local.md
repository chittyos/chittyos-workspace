## ChittyDNA Definition Reminder

**ChittyDNA is NOT preferences or settings.**

ChittyDNA is a **Tier 0 Foundation Trust Anchor** that encodes, stores, and unlocks **provable existence** of entities through evidentiary DNA and Cypher protocol.

### Core Purpose
Enable **fair attribution and compensation** through traceable lineage.

### Double Helix Model
1. **DNA Strand** (Evidence/Identity):
   - Fragments: Atomic units of evidence
   - Entries: Timestamped DNA records
   - Propagations: Where DNA has spread
   - Custody: Chain of control

2. **Cypher Strand** (Protocol/Verification):
   - Encode: Create DNA fingerprints
   - Compare: Match DNA signatures
   - Lineage: Trace provenance
   - Verdict: Determine relationship (copy, paraphrase, mused, inverted, unrelated)

### Verdicts
- **copy**: Direct reproduction
- **paraphrase**: Restated content
- **mused**: Inspired by
- **inverted**: Opposite position
- **unrelated**: No connection

### Key Services
- `dna.chitty.cc` - ChittyDNA API
- Source: `/Volumes/chitty/github.com/CHITTYFOUNDATION/chittydna/`

**Remember**: ChittyDNA proves WHERE things came from, WHO contributed, and ensures FAIR COMPENSATION for original work.
